/**
 * Idiomatic Kotlin operators for [FlixelVector].
 *
 * There are two families here, and the difference matters for performance:
 * - The compound-assignment operators (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`) mutate the vector in place and allocate
 *   nothing. Prefer these in per-frame code.
 * - The binary operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, unary `-`) each return a brand-new [FlixelVector]. They
 *   read cleanly but allocate, so keep them out of hot loops.
 *
 * Destructuring (`val (x, y) = vector`) is also provided and allocates nothing.
