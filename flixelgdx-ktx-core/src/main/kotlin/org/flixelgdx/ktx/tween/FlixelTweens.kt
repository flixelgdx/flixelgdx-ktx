/**
 * A Kotlin builder DSL for [FlixelTween].
 *
 * The Java API drives a tween through a chained-setter [FlixelTweenSettings] object. This DSL
 * collapses those setters into named parameters and moves the property goals into a small builder
 * block, so a tween reads top to bottom:
 *
 * The getter and setter passed to [FlixelTweenGoalScope.goal] map straight to FlixelGDX's primitive
 * `float` goal interfaces, so they run without boxing while the tween updates every frame.
