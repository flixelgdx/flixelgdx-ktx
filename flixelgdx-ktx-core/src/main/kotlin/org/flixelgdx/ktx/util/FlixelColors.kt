 * Idiomatic Kotlin helpers for [FlixelColor].

 * These cover the two things Kotlin users reach for most: unpacking a color into its channels with
 * destructuring, and building a color inline from a packed integer or a hex string. The factory
 * helpers each allocate a new [FlixelColor], so build colors up front rather than in per-frame
 * code.
