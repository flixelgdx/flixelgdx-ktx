/**
 * Boilerplate reducers for [FlixelPool].
 *
 * In Java a pool is created by subclassing [FlixelPool] and overriding `newObject()`. In Kotlin the
 * [flixelPool] builder collapses that ceremony into a single lambda, and [use] borrows an object
 * for the duration of a block and frees it automatically, so callers never forget to return it.
 */

/**
 * Creates a pool that builds new objects with [factory].
 *
 * This avoids the anonymous-subclass ceremony the Java API requires:
 * ```
 * val bullets = flixelPool { Bullet() }
 * val enemies = flixelPool(initialCapacity = 64) { Enemy() }
 * ```
 *
 * The [factory] is stored once on the returned pool, so no allocation happens per obtained object
 * beyond the object itself.
 *
 * @param initialCapacity The starting size of the internal free-object storage.
 * @param max The largest number of free objects to retain; objects freed beyond this are discarded.
 * @param factory Produces a fresh, ready-to-use object when the pool has none free.

 * ```
 * pool.use { bullet -> bullet.fire() }
 * ```
 *
 * The object is freed even if [block] throws. This function is inlined, so the lambda adds no
 * allocation, and it is safe to call every frame.
